Several issues with the Date of Birth field in relation to the Date Picker:
- Date entered by user is not reflected on the Date Picker (Current Date, or last selected Date in Date Picker is shown instead)
 !image-2021-05-21-01-00-36-810.png|thumbnail! 

- Also, after LO-15 occurs, clicking on the Date Picker automatically changes the input to the previously selected Date from Date Picker(even if not yet selected from Date Picker), or previously entered Date. Current input is being overwritten

If the Date Picker will be removed, these issues will be resolved since dependency on Date Picker will be cleared.",,Jenny Ngo Gui,5b595c11dfe79e2c947cdcdd,,,,,,,,,20/May/21 4:00 PM;ug:12d454bb-5cec-44c5-b94e-6a2153f05a8d;image-2021-05-21-01-00-36-810.png;https://jlngogui.atlassian.net/secure/attachment/10002/image-2021-05-21-01-00-36-810.png,,,,,,,,{},,,,,,,,0|i0003b:,,,,,,,,,,,,To Do

After entering date, “Select All” text in date of birth field.
 !image-2021-05-21-00-53-25-717.png|thumbnail! 

The next time you type, for some reason the cursor goes right to the end of the text. And even if you put the text cursor to the unfilled (_) areas, it always goes right to the end of the text. The workaround is to delete the entire text and rewrite everything from left to right.
